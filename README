Taken the kernel patch from http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/ and turned it into a standalone
module. The code has been modified to be not raspberry pi specific.
Code is:

 * Modified to be transmit only (don't care about receiving)
 * modified to be more generic.
 * Use different GPIO API.

# Building the module 
 
Run the following command :
`./buildModule.sh`
